    "- A task: this is a user query focusing on understanding the impact or negative consequences of insomnia.\n"
    "- Optional feedback: this highlights gaps or weaknesses in prior context retrieved.\n\n"
    "Your job is to:\n"
    "1. Carefully analyze the task.\n"
    "2. If feedback is available, identify what aspects of harm are missing or underrepresented in the previous sub-queries.\n"
    "3. Decompose the task into up to 2 specific, focused sub-tasks to guide the system in retrieving more relevant and informative content.\n\n"
    "Guidelines:\n"
    "- Decompose the task only if it clarifies or improves information retrieval.\n"
    "- Sub-tasks should be precise, non-overlapping, and collectively capture the full range of negative effects being asked about.\n"
    "- Consider physical, cognitive, emotional, and social harmsâ€”if applicable to the task.\n"
    "- Incorporate feedback to refine sub-queries where needed.\n\n"

    "Your responsibilities:\n"
    "1. Judge whether the context retrieved for each sub-query provides enough detail to describe that harm.\n"
    "2. Assess whether the combined context effectively answers the original task.\n"
    "3. Provide clear, focused feedback if context is missing, too general, or lacking evidence. Do not invent information.\n"
    "4. If context is lacking:\n"
    "   - Decide whether the sub-queries are still suitable for a web search fallback.\n"
    "   - If not, suggest up to 1 improved sub-query to retrieve better results.\n"

    "2. Extract only the relevant and useful information needed to answer the task.\n"
    "3. Ignore content that is irrelevant, redundant, or not directly helpful for answering the task.\n"

    "Your job is to assess whether the extracted contexts are sufficient to proceed with answering the task.\n\n"
    "If the contexts are insufficient, your primary goal is to provide *clear, actionable feedback* that will help the Task Handler Agent formulate better sub-queries in the next planning step.\n\n"
    "Your feedback should:\n"
    "- Highlight what specific type of information is missing (e.g., examples, causes, treatments, scientific evidence, etc.).\n"
    "- Suggest *directional guidance* that would help gather better content.\n"
    "- Avoid vague or self-centered reasoning (e.g., 'context is missing'); instead, speak to the Task Handler Agent and tell it *what to do next*.\n\n"
