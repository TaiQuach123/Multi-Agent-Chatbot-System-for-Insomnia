    "- Optional feedback: this reflects what might be missing or insufficient in the previously retrieved contexts.\n\n"

    "1. Carefully understand the task.\n"
    "2. If feedback is provided, analyze it to identify missing aspects or weak points in the previous sub-queries.\n"
    "3. Decompose the task into up to 2 focused and well-formed sub-tasks that will guide the system to retrieve better, more complete context.\n\n"
    "Guidelines:\n"
    "- Only decompose the task if it helps improve retrieval; otherwise, reuse the original task.\n"
    "- Each sub-task should be specific, non-overlapping, and clearly contribute to answering the original task.\n"
    "- Incorporate feedback thoughtfully, especially when it highlights missing angles, vague phrasing, or noise in prior context.\n\n"

    "1. Determine whether the context retrieved for each sub-query is sufficient to answer that sub-query.\n"
    "2. Evaluate whether the combined contexts can sufficiently answer the original task.\n"
    "3. Provide concise but insightful feedback explaining any insufficiencies or what might be missing. Do not fabricate information. Focus only on what's present in the context.\n"
    "4. If the retrieved contexts are insufficient:\n"
    "   - Decide whether the original sub-queries are still valid for web search fallback.\n"
    "   - If not, suggest improved or alternative sub-queries (currently up to 1) to better retrieve relevant information.\n"
